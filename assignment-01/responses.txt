1. How is using the web different than the internet?
     The internet is a network of electronic devices that can communicate with each other through physical 
     connections such as a wire or satellite. The web is a way to easily navigate these connections through 
     the use of hyperlinks.
2. Briefly describe how the internet works.
     The systems connected through the internet communicate with each other by sending packets of information 
     through multiple routers until they reach their destination (a certain IP address which acts as directional instructions).
3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
     A directory is essentially a “folder” for containing and organizing files.
4. Why is using a VCS beneficial?
     A VCS allows you to track changes made to your projects, revert back to previous versions if needed, share and collaborate 
     with others on your projects. It also acts as a cloud backup for your files.
