# Assignment 6

## Alexander Stewart

### Forms

I have mostly seen forms used to contact a website owner, or complete an online purchase.

### Examples of Input

- Text
  - Input used to provide a name or email.
- Selection
  - Used to select multiple or a single selection. Could be used in a survey.
- Button Input
  - A submit button could be used to submit the information entered into a form to the website owner.

### Work Cycle

For this assignment I learned about Forms, different types of inputs, and what they all might be used for. I also learned a bit about styling, specifically when it comes to tables. I decided to use radio buttons for the terms of service as it only had two options. If I had a field with many options I would have chosen a select box.
