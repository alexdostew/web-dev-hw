    <h1>Ursula K. Le Guin</h1>
    <h2>A Wizard of Earthsea</h2>
    <h3>Published in 1968</h3>
    <div class="text">
      <p>The island of Gont, a single mountain that lifts its peak a mile above
         the storm-racked Northeast Sea, is a land famous for wizards. From the
         towns in its high valleys and the ports on its dark narrow bays many
         a Gontishman has gone forth to serve the Lords of the Archipelago in
         their cities as wizard or mage, or, looking for adventure, to wander
         working magic from isle to isle of all Earthsea. Of these some say
         the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called
         Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage.
         His life is told of in the Deed of Ged and in many songs, but this
         is a tale of the time before his fame, before the songs were made.

        He was born in a lonely village called Ten Alders, high on the mountain
        at the head of the Northward Vale. Below the village the pastures and
        plow lands of the Vale slope downward level below level towards the
        sea, and other towns lie on the bends of the River Ar; above the
        village only forest rises ridge behind ridge to the stone and snow of
        the heights.

        The name he bore as a child, Duny, was given him by his mother, and
        that and his life were all she could give him, for she died before he
        was a year old. His father, the bronze-smith of the village, was a
        grim unspeaking man, and since Duny's six brothers were older than
        he by many years and went one by one from home to farm the land or
        sail the sea or work as smith in other towns of the Northward Vale,
        there was no one to bring the child up in tenderness. He grew wild,
        a thriving weed, a tall, quick boy, loud and proud and full of
        temper. With the few other children of the village he herded goats
        on the steep meadows above the river-springs; and when he was strong
        enough to push and pull the long bellows-sleeves, his father made him
        work as smith's boy, at a high cost in blows and whippings. There was
         not much work to be got out of Duny. He was always off and away;
         roaming deep in the forest, swimming in the pools of the River Ar
         that like all Gontish rivers runs very quick and cold, or climbing
         by cliff and scarp to the heights above the forest, from which he
         could see the sea, that broad northern ocean where, past Perregal,
         no islands are.
