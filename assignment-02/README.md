## Alexander Stewart

I worked in web development for about 3 years, but I was mostly self taught so I am hoping to get a better understanding of web development as a whole.

- I have learned about readme files and how to use markdown.
- I have learned how the internet works.
- I have learned how data travels on the internet.
