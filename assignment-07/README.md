### Divs, Classes, IDs, and Spans

- Divs are a block-level element that helps group other elements together
- Spans are essentially inline div elements
- The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element. An id can only be assigned to a single element
- The class attribute is like an id attribute, however it can be used on multiple different elements. Both ids and classes are helpful when using CSS.

### Alt Text

Alt text is a description of the element that is mostly used by screen readers for people who are visually impaired.

### Work Cycle

For this assignment I learned about different media elements such as embedding images, video and audio into a website, and incorporated them into the homework assignment. I also reviewed the meta element and learned about escape characters.
