# Final

## Alexander Stewart

### Web Development

I have used GitHub in the past, however I didn't know I could view my webpages with it. I also knew almost nothing about readme files and markdown until taking this course.

### Web Design

For web design, this course taught me a lot about typography, using different fonts, and utilizing iframes.

### Work Cycle

For this assignment I tried to use everything I could remember from the previous assignments to create a final website.
