# Assignment 5

## Alexander Stewart

### head and body elements

There can only be one head element and one body element on a page. The head element holds meta information such as the title of the page, while the body element holds all of the content that will be rendered on the page.

### Structural and Semantic markup

The structural markup includes elements such as headings and paragraphs which help guide a user through the document. It is also used to help the browser understand the content of a document.

The semantic markup is used to add emphasis/meanings to the information in the document. Semantic markup includes elements like italics and strong.
